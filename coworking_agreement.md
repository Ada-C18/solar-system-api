# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*

Open communication! Both through Slack and face-to-face.

## Collaboration vs. individual work expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations- does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

Preference for collaborative approach. Individual, if absolutely necessary.
Switching off driver and navigator and using Zoom's share screen feature to ensure that everyone is on the same page.

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*
Testing and failing/succeeding. EAFP
Bouncing ideas off of each partner through open communication.

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
Straight up but in a respectful manner, no ad hominem attacks. If you notice something, please say it!

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
Irene: Collaboration on code; I feel like I'm still not very good at putting myself into one role, in terms of driver/navigator. Not be bossy.

Katherine: Giving my collaborator space to think and work out things in their own time. Finding more ways to create space for the other person. Not be bossy.

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
Meeting up:
Irene: all weekday hours.
Katherine: weekday mornings preferred, but after core hours possible -- quieter between 8PM and 10PM.
